 - make big doc from pbworks
 - -D param=value for anything in the properties file

1. In a log file, to move the description of what each phase does right after the title and add a number of a current realization, e.g.
*********************************************************************
**** START PHASE 4: Pattern Optimization for realization [1]    *****
*********************************************************************
Since results for parallel runs are written out of order, that will also make a log file easier to read.

2. At the end of Phase 1 there is a table with final expansion factors. After this table, there should be one more table that lists final expansion factors together with a corresponding household ID in a form of "id: final expansion factor"
(makes it easier to catch a problematic household)

3. Instead of -p <phase> option to make -p <pattern optimization minutes> option, where -1 = no phase 4, 0 = run till "optimum" (i.e., not getting an improvement for x number of minutes, and >=1 is the number of minutes phase 4 runs. he default will be 0. (With the [w] and [f] key strokes, the user can stop runs when they please.)

4. [w] and [f] keystrokes as per Chuck's email. Question: how to input them via console in Eclipse?
   "Type [w] to write out current DigPop results and update log file with latest statistics."
   "Type [f] to write out current DigPop results, log file with latest statistics, and exit program."

5. On the wiki, to get a description of all last-run.properties lines

6. To write out intermediate Phase 4 statistics to a separate file whenever results are saved (final stats are to be saved to the log file as usual), ie intermediate stat file name can be something like "intermediate-statistics.txt"
(without this option, all the results are essentially useless if a computer reboots).

7. Private CERL version is still broken or not updated so we can't run conditional simulation.


 - add gadgets to our OMS support
   - expose components/classes to load/build the PDF

loader = dp.Loader
ggc = dp.GeneralizeGISClass
ggc.grid = loader.loadGrid(gridfile)
ggc.input = loader.loadMap(mapfile)
-> ggc.output


loader = dp.GISClass
loader.resample = dp.GISGrid(..)
loader.file = ".."
-> loader.output

Chuck sez priorities:
1) DigPop Documentation
2) DigPop Improvements (Is this done?)
3) DigPop OMS-ization
4) OMS component construction to get GIS data into input form for DigPop and NetLogo



TODO:

 - c_bnd p4 gives up awfully fast
 - phase 4 swaps random hoh in same tract .. even if attrib maps don't allow it!

 - use PopDensityConstraint?
   RegionConstraint?  disable RegionConstraint when MatchConstraint is used?

 - doc: attrib map trait vs constraint
   and doc that attrib map feature that Chuck rejected

 - -r doesn't seem to work (where? cluster-detect, i think)
 
 - add csv metadata support to dp2kml

 - *2kml: add option to disable Overview layer

 - update GUIs to edit multiple <regions> elements

 - GUI: some fields are optional.  allow to be erased!

 - dp2kml: support for custom icons

 - Marina sez: fittingcriteria GUI doesn't really work. I mean none of the buttons (I think except for "open") work - it doesn't allow one to save or save as and it doesn't allow to select a pre-existing fittingcriteria file from the window. And "close" button in "About" doesn't work either.
   - mostly with fc gui

 - create population file generator
      -r random seed
   - linear CDF (probability -> integer)
     map to array of double-ranges, gender/age-range pairs, etc.

 - command line arg to cap amount of time in phase 3 (default none)
   - create polite exit that writes result as-is?

 - finish dp2shp
    dp2shp -r _ -s _ -o _ -x file x y
      -r random seed
      -s select random %
      -o output file name
      -a include all attributes
      -c coord system (default UTM)
      -x create index

 - update docs with new PopDens tab

 - rel file traits get 'nodata-vals="blank,0"'
   fit weights get 'nodata="True,False,Ignore"'
   support in gui
     T/F: add to denom, Ignore: don't
     T: add to numer, F: don't
   -> don't code, just crash on any value we don't currently support

 - tract tab: display min/max next to combos

 - sim should crash if tract.csv has bad (blank, negative) vals

 - second rzn output is hosed

 - try RunAll.bat again, see if 'tests' dir can be whittled and checked in

 - Chuck's `masking layer for phase one' in LandcoverPopulationDensity

 - RelationshipFile classes
    replace String classes with List<>; auto-manage string on import/export
    new LanduseMembersCtrl
    add add/remove methods to all controllers
    overhaul TransferHandlers to use controllers
    should be able to delete getActiveGroup after above



DEFERRED:

 - attribute attraction map
  - each cell describes attributes most desired in that cell
  - raster map + csv table
   - map cell has ID number
   - each ID maps to a row which specifies attrib values desired in that cell
   - attrib is an expression like "1-3,7" or "!7-8"
 -> DEFERRED; may be covered by multiple region maps

 - hot-spot analysis
   - (awaiting design spec)

 - new command-line tool to sift through dp output and compute density function
   - (awaiting design spec)



MIGHT BE NICE:

 - nice Ctrl-C intercept?  (save file then exit)
 - phase pre-1: linear programming
 - phase 4: fudge PopulationRealizations to *exactly* match census data
 - for( int i = cdfs.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
   -> sort cdfs by pop.
 - At line 235, householdsInAggregated and peopleInAggregated represent the number of households and people to create. If you create a new variable "ratioSampleSize", adjusting those variables about line 238 will probably make the program run quicker for testing purposes.
   - SAMPLE_SIZE_PORTION
   - needs to hack the goals too
//TODO //WRZ something ain't right here .. we shouldn't need to do this.
//    our stats are track by *proportion* objects, so the absolute values
//    of numer and denom shouldn't matter.  I think ConflatePums* needs to
//    be fixed.
   -> replaced with P2_RANDOM_TRACT_PROB, etc.
 - eliminate use of low_values
   - see Conflate's minRegionCode and maxRegionCode with Map
   - need to overhaul Proportion
   		 numInRegion = new double[ maxClassValue - minClassValue + 1];
		   totInRegion = new double[ maxClassValue - minClassValue + 1];
 - eliminate GISPoint.iAtts, make PumsHousehold extend GISPoint



DONE:

 - doc: WARNING: Match stat for X eliminated all regions from consideration for PumsHousehold "Y"

 - add diagnostics to ConstrainedRealizer
 - runAllParallel only if >1 rzn
 - updated docs
 - Support ordering and ranking of <position-rules> elements.
 - create proper Realizer from phase 4 code

   - i.e. <phase1>trust="50"</phase1>
 - multi map redesign: new <attribute> element and support
 - multi map redesign: update phase 4 to use these new traits
   - new <phase4> section in fitting criteria
 - update GUIs to not crash with multiple <regions> elements
 - docs: If it can't parse a cell from the households or population tables, it quietly replaces it with -999999.  hoh and pop tables are read as ints.  Note the ID col will appear in the attribs; as int if int, as NODATA if not.
 - docs: hohid/rznid forms unique id
 - docs: in hoh.csv, uid col is optional.  if absent, DP will assign uids by row starting from 1.
   first row = col names, so uid=1 is 2nd line of file.
 - docs: multiple region maps
   if one, traits don't need traitTable.  if >1, they all do.
   only one can have vac/pop/hoh -- this is "primary" map, and must cover entire region of interest
 - docs: phase1-cache contains only the result of analyzing region data, so fiddling with <phase1> does NOT require the analysis to be rerun.
 - support multiple region maps
   - region table per map
   - rel file specifies which region map to use for each trait
 - verify 'trust' really is mandatory
 - replace hohid and rznid with single uid column
 - docs: new <phase1> element
 - docs: dp2kml and csv2kml are same, except:
   - dp2kml supports pop file
   - dp2kml uses db to support larger inputs
   - dp2kml has col name defaults
 - docs: phase3SaveIntermediate also used for phase 4
 - docs: templates:
   Velocity has no general interface for util functions, so I've provided:
   $ConversionTool   $DisplayTool   $MathTool
 - docs: howto pick CRS for *2Kml (SEE BOTTOM)
 - doc: termination conditions for each phase
 - docs: *2Kml style template
 - docs: CsvPlusMap
 - "dial" indicates trust in survey vs aggregate data
   - multiplier is called "expansion factor"
   -> 100% use phase 1; 0% use naive multiplier or cols below; 50% use halfway between
   -> optional expansion factor column
   -> optional column to provide std dev; above col will be interpreted as mean, and multiplier will be random
 - list 11/24 #5: weights should support 0-infinity
 - buff csv2kml to match dp2kml
 - ensure new lpd-*.csv files with comments can be fed back into DP
 - dump phase 4 every hour
 - download "arcgis explorer", make kmz work with it
 - list 11/24 #4: create two CSV files:
   - for each region, for each class, print #pop
   - again for %land
 - log the existance of aux tables and maps that are written
 - make phase1 print log like phase3
 - list 11/24 #7: phase 1 "quality of" tables should be folded together so before and after values appear adjacent
 - bug report 12/3 #1: blank cells should be replaced with NODATA
 - bug report 12/3 #2: round floats probabilistically
 - dump number clones:  print WARNING for every zero
 - BUG: random.nextInt cannot accept zero!!
 - list 11/24 #3: print ******* lines to clearly separate phases
 - list 11/24 #2: Print quantities of archtypes 20 per line
 - list 11/24 #1: trait includes 'desc' field, so make Proportion and Count use it
 - Google Earth placemark styling
  - determine the color/size/symbol of the households based on attributes within the CSV file
   - when enabled, generate style for every placemark.  when disabled, use style file
 - use getId when writing SERIALNO to csv files
   householdID is ok, SERIALNO is broken
 + p3: don't undo failed move; just keep moving until done, then move to best tract found
 + p3: 1. start at random archtype; on success, pick another random; on fail, do in order
 + p3: 2. start at random rzn #
 + p3: 3. skip to next archtype if rzn is moved
 + p3: 4. skip rzn if its tract has already been tested (valid only because of 3)
          (if rzn won't move, don't do the other copies of the tract number)
 + print suitable abort message when p3 can't find more moves
 + print final stats line when p3 ends for any reason
 - make beta/error print class names
 - don't write pop file if we didn't get one
 - LPD table in log should print class description too
 - relationship file: <landuse> element class # collisions must be detected and alerted
   i.e. vacant="20", then some other class gets mapped to 20 -- what happens?
 - end phase 3 when the loops complete with no changes; eliminate timer
 - phase 4: if enabled, then write_all_fields must be enabled too
 - phase3_time_limit=0 stops immediately
 - when phase 4 ends, print big table:
   - Lag | Init Iner | Cur Iner | Goal Iner | Cur Reduc | Goal Reduc 
 - refine goal reduction
 - "reduction", not "improvement"
 - move both_ends into last-run, default TRUE
 - After phase 4 is done, have the log file indicate how much the shortest lag was reduced.
 - save results of phase3 and phase4 for comparison
 - docs for dp2kml
 - doc: loc wt needs to be fine-tuned
 - doc: DP needs *planar* coords, i.e. UTM
   (i think most phases work fine, but phase 4 will act funny if not planar)
 - doc: phases, and how params shortcut them, and how they use files
 - doc: the <cluster> element!
 - if <cluster> is missing or empty, skip phase 4
 - phase4_time_limit
 - phase 4 should say why it's stopping: no more moves, achieved improvement, timed out
 - P4: use all traits plus <cluster> element
 - P4: new quality evaluation:
   calc initial PSV
   multiply inertial vals by % improvement, progressively, out to distance:
     1st lag *= %
     lag at given distance *= 1.0
     interpolate % for the lags between
     ** this becomes our GOAL PSV
   use chuck's spread() to keep swaps that move psv closer to goal
 - P4: user sez "i want 50% improvement out to 150m"
   -> new <cluster trait amount distance> elements in fittingcriteria

   fit is same as end of phase 2!!  what happend to phase 3?
 - why is RI wrong with -s 0
   - cuz it can't handle trait that calcs abs pop
 - LPD-input should not include cols that are all zero
 - LPD-landuse.csv receives all classes with zeros for the bad ones.  include the names from rel file

   - pdf was built wrong
 - force min number of rzns of each archtype to be no less than one
 - PumsQuery support multiple ranges
 - use java.util.logging instead of System.out
   Logger.getLogger("rgik")
   by default, write log to output dir as well as screen
 - trait table auto-creates rows too much when table dropdown selected
 - trait table add/remove does wrong rows
 - trait select docs: if spec'd, values are averaged over what's specd' by total
 - population tooltips
 - changing name of group doesn't update Members title
 - docs for select.java
 - add "1" as the first option in Total Field

 - write population file
 - don't compute easting/northing for households, only keep tract numbers
   - condense arrays as much as possible (i.e. PumsHousehold.realizations only contains tract nums)
   - generate easting/northing when writing files
 - remove # comments from csv files, mangle file name instead (or create txt file)
 - run phase1 once only if needed, cache the result
 - BooleanGrid use BitSet, not boolean[]
 - phase 2 only uses 1 cell in each tract
 - fittingcriteria must contain ENTIRE list of traits (verify none are missing)

 - also write population: x,y,archetype,id,(copy of population record)
 - nuke optInitial0.txt, rename above outputs to rzn#<num>-<table>.csv
 - rename rtrait in fitting file
 - crash if not all landuse classes have been mapped
 - crash if a class has been spec'd twice
 - critical bugs:
   - CSVTable.findAllRowsWithAttribute didn't copy array when enlarging
   - Conflat* off-by-one error
     for( int j = 0; j < numHouseholdArchtypes - 1; j++) {
       numArchtypes2Make[ j] = 100;
		 }
 - replace ALL Math.random with Random object
   -> everything currently important is done.

 - move Reclass to core, make test, replace SkipList with Map<int,int>, del ActionObject
 - replace LinkList with java.util.LinkedList
 - replace EmptyListException with EmptyStackException



DENIED:

 - move ESRI I/O into own class, same for GRASS4
   - methods work better sprinkled into their classes
 - is there an official "java bean" spec? what's a "bean function" look like? fix Reclass to match.
   - Yes.  Sun's bean spec v1.01 sect 2.2 says:
     "The methods a Java Bean exports are just normal Java methods which can be called from other components or from a scripting environment. By default all of a bean’s public methods will be exported, but a bean can choose to export only a subset of its public methods (see Section 8.5)."
   - thus methods should be implemented as ordinary methods.
   - to turn reclass into a bean, we'll want to think about how an actual gui should work, and decide the best properties and events for that.  (i.e. if a table changes, does reclass auto-re-run?)



QUESTIONS:

none.


ANSWERED:

 - chuck mentioned full phase1 yields superior result to random phase1.  How do you tell?
   (I verified it's *faster* .. after 18 hrs, still wan't done.)
   -> fitness
 - why don't you just use 100% census data?
   -> government(s) won't allow access
   -> in some places, it's not collected
 - what's the value to phase2? could replace with fast random placment, let phase3 do all the work?
   -> phase2 and 3 seem to have identical algorithms, but Chuck's early testing indicated phase2 improves the final results.
 - bump QT to 100 pts per node, check speed
   -> QuadTree serialization test much slower at 100 than 10
